# TTT4175-Estimation-Project-1
Before running the code make sure numpy, matplotlib and scipy are installed. Once this is done, nothing needs to be changed or added to the code for it to run, you can simply run it from your favourite IDE.

The evaluation of the performance of the MLE is found in 1a.py. Running this file will show plots of the mean error and variance of the estimators for omega and phi. The number of iterations is set to 100 which should take a couple of minutes to run. The number of iterations can be changed by changing the ITERATIONS variable.

The numeric fine tuning is found in 1b.py. Running this file generates similar plots as 1a.py. The number of iterations is also set to 100 and can be changed in the same way.
